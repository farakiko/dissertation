This is the source code for my doctoral dissertation.

## Building

Some notes for future me:

 - Bibliography entries are first processed using `process_bib.py` to manually fix things like changing the author entry for CMS publications to "CMS Collaboration", removing unnecessary fields, etc.
   - This is added to the VSCode `latex-workshop` build recipe in `.vscode/settings.json`
